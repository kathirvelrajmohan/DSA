# Data Structures and Algorithms in Java

Welcome to my repository for learning data structures and algorithms in Java! In this repository, you'll find code examples and implementations of various data structures and algorithms as I learn and practice them.


## Introduction

As a software developer, it's essential to have a strong foundation in data structures and algorithms. This repository serves as my personal learning journey to master these fundamental concepts using the Java programming language.

## Learning Resources

I'm currently learning from a YouTube channel called Kunal Kushwaha. He covers topics in a more straightforward manner and solves interview problems commonly asked in companies like Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and more.
- [YouTube - Data Structures and Algorithms Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9gnSGHSqcnr_DxHsP7AW9ftq0AtAyYqJ)

You can find the Java implementations of these algorithms in their respective folders.

Currently, I have learned Linear Search and Binary Search from this playlist.
